# **Car Price Prediction**

## Overview:

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other specifications. The model leverages regression techniques to analyze price trends and provide accurate price estimations.

## Technologies Used:

 1. Programming Language: Python
 2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
 3. Machine Learning Model: Regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
 4. Dataset: Car price dataset (sourced from Kaggle or any other reliable source)

## Features

 1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
 2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization
 3. Feature engineering and selection
 4. Model training and evaluation
 5. Price prediction based on input features

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:
 1. Car Brand & Model: The make and model of the car
 2. Year: Year of manufacture
 3. Mileage: Distance traveled by the car
 4. Fuel Type: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.
 5. Transmission: Manual or Automatic
 6. Engine Size: Measured in CC
 7. Price: Target variable (dependent variable)

## Installation & Setup

 1.Clone the repository:
  > git clone https://github.com/akshit3456/Car-Price-Prediction.git.

 2. Navigate to the project directory:
  > cd Car-Price-Prediction

 3. Add dataset:
  > Add dataset file to the content folder.

 4. Run the project:
  > Connect collab file and click run all cell from top run options.

## Results & Evaluation

 1. The model achieves an accuracy of X% (based on RÂ² score) on the test dataset.
 2. Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression in handling non-linearity in data.
 3. Feature importance analysis showed that Year, Mileage, and Brand had the most impact on car prices.

## Future Enhancements

 1. Improve model accuracy with more feature engineering
 2. Incorporate deep learning models for better predictions
 3. Deploy the model as a web application
 4. Integrate real-time data for price prediction

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust approach to predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.
