Car Price Prediction

Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other specifications. The model leverages regression techniques to analyze price trends and provide accurate price estimations.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Model: Regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Dataset: Car price dataset (sourced from Kaggle or any other reliable source)

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization

Feature engineering and selection

Model training and evaluation

Price prediction based on input features

Dataset

The dataset consists of:

Car Brand & Model: The make and model of the car

Year: Year of manufacture

Mileage: Distance traveled by the car

Fuel Type: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.

Transmission: Manual or Automatic

Engine Size: Measured in CC

Price: Target variable (dependent variable)

Project Workflow

Data Collection: Load dataset from a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Remove duplicate records

Convert categorical data into numerical values (encoding)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing price distribution

Correlation analysis using heatmaps

Feature importance analysis

Model Selection & Training:

Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score

Model Testing & Prediction:

Test model accuracy on unseen data

Predict car prices based on user input

Deployment (Optional):

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd car-price-prediction

Install dependencies:

Add dataset to the content folder

Run the project:

connect python collab file and run all cell

Results & Evaluation

The model achieves an accuracy of X% (based on R² score) on the test dataset.

Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression in handling non-linearity in data.

Feature importance analysis showed that Year, Mileage, and Brand had the most impact on car prices.

Future Enhancements

Improve model accuracy with more feature engineering

Incorporate deep learning models for better predictions

Deploy the model as a web application

Integrate real-time data for price prediction

Conclusion

This project provides a robust approach to predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.
